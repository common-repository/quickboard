Replace the WP-dashboard with this custom dashboard.

== Description ==

Quickboard replaces the standard Wordpress backend and dashboard. Only user with the new created role "Quickboard" will see this custom dashboard. All regular admin menu elements are hidden.
The idea is, that a certain group of user will have directly access to pages / options of the WP-admin that are set with this plugin.

== Installation ==

1. Upload 'quickboard.zip' through Wordpress 'Plugins' installation menu
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why having a custom dashboard? =

It helps user that are not familiar with Wordpress to work in admin area.
They only can directly access the pages / options they have to and not get confused
by lots of links in the menu.

= Does it work with any menu item? =

Yes and no. Yes you can set a button-link, but in some cases, when for example a plugin got own 
roles or capabilities, the access to that linked page / option is not granted and Wordpress will shown 
an error 'Sorry, you are not allowed to access this page.'.
This applies mostly for SEO plugins.
